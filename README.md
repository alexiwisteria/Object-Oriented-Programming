# Object-Oriented Programming Class Projects

Welcome to the repository that contains all of the work I completed during my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** class. This repository demonstrates my understanding of fundamental OOP concepts, design patterns, and practical implementations. Each project highlights different aspects of OOP, such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, along with hands-on coding examples.


## Overview

This repository showcases several projects and assignments I worked on throughout my OOP course. These projects cover key OOP principles, object-oriented design patterns, and practical problem-solving skills in Java. By organizing and documenting this code, I aim to provide an easily navigable collection of my academic work that highlights my growth and understanding of object-oriented software development.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java
- **Development Environment:** IntelliJ IDEA
- **Build Tool:** Maven 

## Contributions

This repository is a reflection of my work in the OOP class. However, feel free to fork the repository if you wish to explore or expand upon any of the projects. Contributions are always welcome!
